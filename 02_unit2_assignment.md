### Describe trends in AI uses: as mainstream in efficiency and productivity gains. 

According to MIT, artificial intelligence trends (from 2020 onwards) include user experience analytics: as time goes on, artificial intelligence will take a key role in understanding how users interact with services, in order to improve them.  

Social movements against racism (such as Black Lives Matter and Stop Asian Hate) have made headlines on hundreds of news pages. It is important to mention that, in social networks, there have been advances in the detection of hate speech and content that promotes discrimination. Facebook has been one of the companies that has invested the most in these technologies, aided by artificial intelligence for the analysis of texts containing these speeches. 


### Automation and augmentation of work with machine learning algorithms.

Due to the pandemic, it is well known that a good number of jobs (especially those that require a lot of contact with people, such as a cashier) have been lost. As Time magazine explains in a 2020 article, robots and artificial intelligence algorithms are automating and replacing jobs at a rate never seen before. Yes, as some other authors mention, new jobs are being generated, but the current situation makes it difficult for many people to train to welcome new jobs. 

### The characteristics of big data and cloud computing.

In their article "Big data in the time of a pandemic", Zeba Siddiqui and Francis Rathinam give an excellent explanation of the impacts of big data in these pandemic times. To put this in context, given that the Covid-19 situation has led to more people being at home, this has increased the number of online services, and with it, the data generated by them. Large companies may not have as many problems working with huge amounts of information, but a large number of small and medium-sized companies have only just learned about Big Data, and that brings with it many problems. The main problem is that they do not know how to handle the information nor do they have the IT infrastructure to take advantage of it. This has meant that many companies have had to start spending money on specialists and services to take advantage of their data. This is perhaps only an advantage for the large companies that offer these services (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and for the specialists hired, could this be a solution to the labor crisis resulting from the pandemic? Time will tell. 

### What is Blockchain?

According to the virtual encyclopedia Investopedia, a blockchain is a “distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.” 

On the IBS Intelligence portal, Leandra Monteiro explains that blockchain technology has been the subject of much controversy in the last two years. Bitcoin has not had the best luck of all, and yet, it seems that every day new currencies based on this technology emerge. The way the economy is managed has changed a lot due to the pandemic, which is why digital commerce and transfers have been more successful than doing it physically. This is where cryptocurrencies come in. Although they are not at their best, they are of great importance in contexts like the current one, in which less human contact is needed. As always, time will tell if this is the best solution. 

### What is hyperledger 

This project was born from the effort of the Linux Foundation and several allied companies to create a collaborative development platform focused on blockchain technology and its potential industrial and business uses. 

Hyperledger's main goal was not to create a blockchain with a currency and launch it into the crypto market. Its real goal is to design technologies that will leverage the structure that Bitcoin had brought, try to separate the currency and leverage the way blockchain works in other scenarios. 


### Financial transactions  

This can be better be explained by the two different processes that occur simultaneously. On one hand, the acquisition of a product or service and, on the other, the payment in exchange for the receipt of that resource.  

In the case of large finance, the payment for this acquisition might not be monetary. In the business world, the exchange can be carried out using other methods of payment and without the acquisition of goods. For example, in this type of financial transaction there may be an exchange of currencies or other assets, without involving either goods or capital. 


### Digital currencies 

First of all,  it is neccesary to clarify that digital currencies already exist: the reserves held by commercial banks in central banks or the payments we make by credit card are examples of digital money. 

There are two different types: private digital currencies (such as bitcoin) or a digital currency that is guaranteed by the central bank. Private digital currencies may seem an attractive option, but they suffer from certain limits that make it difficult for their use to spread successfully. On the other hand, the institutional mechanisms enjoyed by the central bank in the financial system may facilitate a more fruitful implementation. 


### Technical obstacles and political challenges 

The first problem is the continuous "mining" of bitcoins and other digital assets because it generates an enormous consumption of electricity that is incompatible with the requirements of responsible investment. 

According to some experts "bitcoin is not an 'investable' asset, (beyond its lack of sustainability): there are no cash flows, no residual value, no use value, and it is too volatile to be used as a means of payment." 

If we add to this the small but existing possibility of altering the blockchain by breaching the cybersecurity of the protocol, the acceptance by the general public is still too complicated.
