**1. What is Data Management?**

It is the development, execution, and supervision of plans, policies, programs, and practices that deliver, control, protect, and enhance the value of data and information assets throughout their lifecycles.

**2. Who is a Data Management Professional?**

It is any person who works in any facet of data management (from technical management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensuring that data is properly utilized and leveraged) to meet strategic organizational goals. 

**3. What are the Data management activities?**

Data management activities are wide-ranging. They include everything from the ability to make consistent decisions about how to get strategic value from data to the technical deployment and performance of databases. Thus data management requires both technical and non-technical (i.e., ‘business’) skills.

**4. Who is responsable for managing data?**
 
 Responsibility for managing data must be shared between business and information technology roles, and people in both areas must be able to collaborate to ensure an organization has high quality data that meets its strategic needs.

**5. What is Data and Information?**

Data and information are not just assets in the sense that organizations invest in them in order to derive future value. Data and information are also vital to the day-to-day operations of most organizations. They have been called the ‘currency’, the ‘life blood’, and even the ‘new oil’ of the information economy.1 Whether or not an organization gets value from its analytics, it cannot even transact business without data.

**6. What are the data management goals?**

- Understanding and supporting the information needs of the enterprise and its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and business partners
- Capturing, storing, protecting, and ensuring the integrity of data assets
- Ensuring the quality of data and information
- Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of stakeholder data
- Preventing unauthorized or inappropriate access, manipulation, or use of data and information
- Ensuring data can be used effectively to add value to the enterprise

**7. What are the Data Management Principles?**

- Data is an asset with unique properties: Data is an asset, but it differs from other assets in important ways that influence how it is managed. The most obvious of these properties is that data is not consumed when it is used, as are financial and physical assets.
- The value of data can and should be expressed in economic terms: Calling data an asset implies that it has value. While there are techniques for measuring data’s qualitative and quantitative value, there are not yet standards for doing so. Organizations that want to make better decisions about their data should develop consistent ways to quantify that value. They should also measure both the costs of low quality data and the benefits of high quality data.
- Managing data means managing the quality of data: Ensuring that data is fit for purpose is a primary goal of data management. To manage quality, organizations must ensure they understand stakeholders’ requirements for quality and measure data against these requirements.
- It takes Metadata to manage data: Managing any asset requires having data about that asset (number of employees, accounting codes, etc.). The data used to manage and use data is called Metadata. Because data cannot be held or touched, to understand what it is and how to use it requires definition and knowledge in the form of Metadata. 

**8. What is data valuation?**

Value is the difference between the cost of a thing and the benefit derived from that thing. For some assets, like stock, calculating value is easy. It is the difference between what the stock cost when it was purchased and what it was sold for. But for data, these calculations are more complicated, because neither the costs nor the benefits of data are standardized.
Since each organization’s data is unique to itself, an approach to data valuation needs to begin by articulating general cost and benefit categories that can be applied consistently within an organization. 

**9. What are the categories for data valuation?**

Cost of obtaining and storing data
- Cost of replacing data if it were lost
- Impact to the organization if data were missing
- Cost of risk mitigation and potential cost of risks associated with data
- Cost of improving data
- Benefits of higher quality data
- What competitors would pay for data
- What the data could be sold for
- Expected revenue from innovative uses of data

**10. What is  Data Quality in Data Management?**

Ensuring that data is of high quality is central to data management. Organizations manage their data because they want to use it. If they cannot rely on it to meet business needs, then the effort to collect, store, secure, and enable access to it is wasted. To ensure data meets business needs, they must work with data consumers to define these needs, including characteristics that make data of high quality.

**11. What are the benefits of high quality data?**

Improved customer experience
- Higher productivity
- Reduced risk
- Ability to act on opportunities
- Increased revenue
- Competitive advantage gained from insights on customers, products, processes, and opportunities

**12. What is planning in Data Management?**

Planning for better data requires a strategic approach to architecture, modeling, and other design functions. It also depends on strategic collaboration between business and IT leadership. And, of course, it depends on the ability to execute effectively on individual projects.

**13. What is Metadata and Data Management?**

Organizations require reliable Metadata to manage data as an asset. Metadata in this sense should be understood comprehensively. Metadata describes what data an organization has, what it represents, how it is classified, where it came from, how it moves within the organization, how it evolves through use, who can and cannot use it, and whether it is of high quality. Data is abstract.

The challenge is that Metadata is a form of data and needs to be managed as such. Organizations that do not manage their data well generally do not manage their Metadata at all. Metadata management often provides a starting point for improvements in data management overall.

**14. What is Establishing an Enterprise Perspective?**

Managing data requires understanding the scope and range of data within an organization. Data is one of the ‘horizontals’ of an organization. It moves across verticals, such as sales, marketing, and operations... Or at least it should. Data is not only unique to an organization; sometimes it is unique to a department or other sub-part of an organization. Because data is often viewed simply as a by-product of operational processes is not always planned for beyond the immediate need.

**15. Does the data have a life cycle?**

Like other assets, data has a lifecycle. To effectively manage data assets, organizations need to understand and plan for the data lifecycle. Well-managed data is managed strategically, with a vision of how the organization will use its data. A strategic organization will define not only its data content requirements, but also its data management requirements. These include policies and expectations for use, quality, controls, and security; an enterprise approach to architecture and design; and a sustainable approach to both infrastructure and software development.

**16. Does Metadata quality must be managed in the same way as the quality of other data?**

Yes, Because Metadata is a form of data, and because organizations rely on it to manage other data, Metadata quality must be managed in the same way as the quality of other data.

**17. Does the data require protection throughout its lifecycle?**

Yes, Data management also includes ensuring that data is secure and that risks associated with data are mitigated. Data that requires protection must be protected throughout its lifecycle, from creation to disposal .

**18. Does Data Management efforts should focus on the most critical data?**

Yes, Organizations produce a lot of data, a large portion of which is never actually used. Trying to manage every piece of data is not possible. Lifecycle management requires focusing on an organization’s most critical data and minimizing data ROT (Data that is Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) (Aiken, 2014).

**19. Does Low quality data represents a risk?**

Yes, Data not only represents value, it also represents risk. Low quality data (inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date) obviously represents risk because its information is not right. But data is also risky because it can be misunderstood and misused.

**20. What is a strategy in Data Management?**

A data strategy should include business plans to use information to competitive advantage and support enterprise goals. Data strategy must come from an understanding of the data needs inherent in the business strategy: what data the organization needs, how it will get the data, how it will manage it and ensure its reliability over time, and how it will utilize it.
Typically, a data strategy requires a supporting Data Management program strategy a plan for maintaining and improving the quality of data, data integrity, access, and security while mitigating known and implied risks. The strategy must also address known challenges related to data management.

**21. What are the components of a data management strategy?**

- A compelling vision for data management
- A summary business case for data management, with selected examples
- Guiding principles, values, and management perspectives
- The mission and long-term directional goals of data management
- Proposed measures of data management success
- Short-term (12-24 months) Data Management program objectives that are SMART specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, time-bound)
- Descriptions of data management roles and organizations, along with a summary of their responsibilities and decision rights
- Descriptions of Data Management program components and initiatives
- A prioritized program of work with scope boundaries
- A draft implementation roadmap with projects and action items

What are the Deliverables from strategic planning for data management?
- A Data Management Charter: Overall vision, business case, goals, guiding principles, measures of success, critical success factors, recognized risks, operating model, etc.
- A Data Management Scope Statement: Goals and objectives for some planning horizon (usually 3 years) and the roles, organizations, and individual leaders accountable for achieving these objectives.
- A Data Management Implementation Roadmap: Identifying specific programs, projects, task assignments, and delivery milestones.

**22. What is the Strategic Alignment Model?**

The Strategic Alignment Model (Henderson and Venkatraman, 1999) abstracts the fundamental drivers for any approach to data management. At its center is the relationship between data and information. Information is most often associated with business strategy and the operational use of data. Data is associated with information technology and processes which support physical management of systems that make data accessible for use. Surrounding this concept are the four fundamental domains of strategic choice: business strategy, information technology strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and information technology infrastructure and processes.

**23. What is the The Amsterdam Information Model?**

The Amsterdam Information Model, like the Strategic Alignment Model, takes a strategic perspective on business and IT alignment (Abcouwer, Maes, and Truijens, 1997),13 Known as the 9-cell, it recognizes a middle layer that focuses on structure and tactics, including planning and architecture. Moreover, it recognizes the necessity of information communication.

**24. What is Data handling ethics?**

Data handling ethics are concerned with how to procure, store, manage, use, and dispose of data in ways that are aligned with ethical principles. Handling data in an ethical manner is necessary to the long- term success of any organization that wants to get value from its data. 

**25. What is the risk of Unethical data handling?**

Unethical data handling can result in the loss of reputation and customers, because it puts at risk people whose data is exposed. In some cases, unethical practices are also illegal.18 Ultimately, for data management professionals and the organizations for which they work, data ethics are a matter of social responsibility.
