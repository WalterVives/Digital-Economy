### 1. What does it imply that cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized control? (Oswaldo Chan)

The fact that they are decentralized control means that there is no counterparty to manage the asset. For example, if I have a virtual wallet and I lose my access password, I have lost the money, since there is no one who can give it back to me. 

### 2. What is Cloud Computing used for in a company? (Oswaldo Chan)

Depending on the type of company and sector, the functions offered by Cloud Computing can be used to a greater or lesser extent. Some common examples are the storage of data in the cloud, the installation of business management tools (ERP, CRM), or the possibility of having a virtual desktop. 


### 3. Why is it said that the generation of cryptocurrencies pollutes the environment? (Oswaldo Chan)

It depends on each cryptocurrency, but, for example, bitcoin requires a huge level of electricity to be mined. Since much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources, it tends to be highly polluting. 

### 4. Why is the value of cryptocurrencies so volatile? (Oswaldo Chan)

On one hand, the price of any good is defined by supply and demand, and officiates as a generalized consensus on the value of that good. In this case, where the underlying concepts of a currency are often complex, that consensus is not so easy to reach. 

On the other hand, most of its members are retail investors (domestic investors), who are extremely sensitive and vulnerable to their emotions, and the price fluctuates accordingly. 

### 5. Will bitcoins ever run out? (Oswaldo Chan)
 
It will be in the year 2030 when bitcoin mining will come to an end. The year is exact because the amount of virtual currency in circulation is also exact: by then there will be 21 million units. 

### 6. What jobs will disappear with artificial intelligence? (Alan Peraza) 

It is estimated that 47% of jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence in the next 20 years. Researcher Carl Benedikt Frey mentioned some of the jobs that are most susceptible to sudden replacement; 

* Administrative Employees 
* Operators and Salespeople 
* Receptionists and waiters 
* Cooks and janitors 

 
### 7. How is the legislation on Artificial Intelligence in the world? (Alan Peraza) 

Although the world powers are trying to be the leader in artificial intelligence (China, USA, Europe), only the United Arab Emirates has a Minister of Artificial Intelligence, although it does not have any law in this regard. It could be said that, to date, there is still no legislation on artificial intelligence. 

### 8. How is a digital currency obtained? How is the virtual mechanism for acquiring this type of currency? (Alan Peraza) 

Digital currencies can be obtained from recognized exchanges, Uphold, PandaExchange, Cryptobuyer are some common examples. They can be obtained through wallet transfers and even at certain ATMs, but the latter option is not so common yet. 

### 9. For which area are the main currencies targeted? (Alan Peraza) 

The student can cite any of the following examples: 

* Ethereum, allows the creation of smart contracts based on blockchain. 
* Ripple, works as a centralized banking network, BBVA and Santander use it in their operations. 
* Dash (digital cash) allows instant, private and secure transactions. 

### 10. What is still a point of concern in the deployment of services in Cloud Computing? (Alan Peraza) 

The security of data.

### 11. Can the blockchain be hacked? (Walter Vives)
No. In the blockchain, all transactions are recorded, in such a way that it works as a large social network in which all miners self-verify with each other, giving validity to each transaction by the simple fact of having 'seen' it.

### 12. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? (Walter Vives)

"It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."  John McCarthy 2004

### 13. Mention 3 advantages of cloud computing? (Walter Vives)
1. Back-up and restore data: Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.
2. Improved collaboration: Cloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.
3. Excellent accessibility: Cloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world, using an internet connection. An internet cloud infrastructure increases organization productivity and efficiency by ensuring that our data is always accessible.

### 14. WHow Many Cryptocurrencies are There? (Walter Vives)
In short, there are nearly over 6,000 as of 2021. (Statista)

### 15. What Are the Different Types of Crypto? (Walter Vives)

Different types of crypto generally fall into one of two categories:
- Coins, which can include Bitcoin and altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies)
- Tokens, which are programmable assets that live within the blockchain of a given platform.

### 16. What are the differences between Crypto Coins and Tokens? (Walter Vives)

While coins and tokens are considered forms of cryptocurrency, they provide different functions. Coins are built on their own blockchain and they’re intended as a form of currency. Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain, for example.

### 17. What Are Altcoins? (Walter Vives)

The name “altcoin” began as a shorthand for “alternative to Bitcoin,” and most altcoins were launched to improve upon Bitcoin in some way. Some examples of altcoins include: Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Ethereum, and USD Coin.

Like Bitcoin, some cryptocurrencies have a limited supply of coins — which helps create demand and reinforce their perceived value. For example, there is a fixed number of Bitcoins that can be created — 21 million, as decided by the creator(s) of Bitcoin.

Though most altcoins are built on the same basic framework as Bitcoin and share some of its characteristics, each one offers investors something different. Some altcoins use a different process to produce and validate blocks of transactions. Some might offer new features, like smart contracts or an advantage like lower price volatility.

### 18. What are Tokens? (Walter Vives)

Tokens are usually created and given out through an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, very much like a stock offering. They can be represented as:

- Value tokens (like bitcoins)
- Security tokens (which are similar to stocks)
- Utility tokens (designated for specific uses)

Like American dollars, tokens represent value, but they are not exactly valuable themselves, in the same way a paper dollar’s value may not be $1. But tokens can be used in transactions for other things.

A token differs from a coin in the way it’s constructed within the blockchain of an existing coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

### 19. How exactly do you get your virtual hands on different types of cryptocurrency? (Walter Vives)
 
 You can buy it the old-fashioned way, by buying it on an exchange like Coinbase (or using your SoFi Invest® account). You can also trade crypto on an exchange for other types of crypto (for example, using tethers to buy bitcoin). Some blogs and media platforms pay their content providers in crypto.

Then there are the miners. Miners usually don’t pay directly for their crypto; they earn it in various ways: e.g., through a painstaking, high-tech process of verifying transactions on a blockchain network.

Sounds sweet, but mining isn’t cheap. It requires powerful, expensive hardware and lots of electricity, and the competition can be fierce. Once we bought into Bitcoin because its security was first demonstrated—at one point generating 1 million Bitcoins per second —there wasn't much left over when our power costs doubled every five years or so. The most successful digital currencies use nonrefundable hard sell fees that help them survive once everyone is paying attention. And if all else fails, many currency exchanges offer Bitfinex "bitcoin insurance," which means both those who want to convert bitcoins quickly from fiat back onto dollars need not worry about losing what little cash exists now until later with new payments coming online under less risky alternative forms such as NFC chips and QR codes.

### 20. How to make a cryptocurrency? (Walter Vives)
1. Choose a Consensus Mechanism.
2. Pick a Blockchain Platform.
3. Design The Nodes.
4. Establish Blockchain's Internal Architecture.
5. Integrate APIs.
6. Design The Interface.
7. Make Your Cryptocurrency Legal.
