## General View of the Digital Economy.
### Growth of the Digital Economy

To begin with, as we have talked in the previous assignment Digital Economy started in a long time, and it has changed over the time to be able to satisfy the human necessities. 
We are living through an era of spectacular technological change, any type of digital technologies is becoming faster, more powerful and even cheaper than it used to be. Technological breakthrough has become a central driver of global economy growth and its importance is growing. 

In general, Digital Economy has growth from many aspects, such as technology manufacturing sectors including mining, agriculture, constructions, on the other hand it includes the aspects from business perspective including productivity, in which the past 3 decades, it went from 1 million investment to 20 million in GDP. 

From other perspective it has improved the availability and capability of computing power demonstrating that the digital technologies are not constrained by geography or industry and that consequently the production of digital technologies and services are truly globalized.

### Information and communication technologies (ICT) Indicators

In fact, the recent grow of the Digital Economy in many fields has developed what we can call the ICT indicators we must consider that some of them changes according to the institutions that register it and over the time they increase. 

ICT indicators plays a crucial point now, including policies and strategies on its own growth. These indicators include fields of Computer programming, software, IT, design etcetera because they are a combination of manufacturing and services that capture, transmit and display data and information electronically.

These ICT indicators are divided into: 

- ICT infrastructure and Access which is usually focused in fixed-telephone, mobile cellular, fixed broadband internet subscriptions among others. 
- ICT access and use by households and individuals which is focused into proportion of households with radio, tv, telephone, computer, internet among others.
- ICT access and use by enterprises which is usually focused into proportion of business using computers, internet, or business with a web presence, intranet, receive and placing order over the internet.
- ICT sector and trade in ICT goods which is focused into business sector workforce, gross value added, and percentage of total imports and exports.
- ICT in Education which is focused into the proportion of schools with a radio, television, telephone among other for educational purposes.
- ICT in government which is focused into proportion of employer working in government organization and uses over the network.

### ICT-based business models

The ICT indicators consequently created the necessity to develop ICT Models to satisfy the needs, some of them are: 
*	Product Innovation and Value Proposition which the main purpose is the creation of value that customers are willing to pay for it. This refers to what business the company is in and what bundle of products and services it offers on the market.
*	Customer Relationship which covers all customer-related aspects. This comprises the choice of a firm’s target customers, the channels through which it gets in touch with them and the kind of relationships the company wants to establish with its customers. It is divided in “target customer”, “channels” and “relationships”.
*	Among other models there are: Infrastructure Management and Financial Aspects

### Strategic Data Analysis

These strategies start with the data acquisition and analysis that are critical elements in strategic measurement and control system effectiveness. It usually contends “strategic controllers” that should undertake such a process in order to understand the underlying driers of strategic results. 
However, no matter what, these aim to the business to know and on what customers are spending their money. 
These will vary depending upon your place and objective, some examples of these are: 
* Category Management/sku Rationalization
*	Consumer Decision Tree/Product Attributes
*	SPPD – Sales Per Point of Distribution
*	ACV – All Commodity Volume
*	Power Ranking
*	Gap Analysis – Prioritized
*	Average SKU – Straight or Blended
*	Promotional Planning & Assessment
This is a key element both in developing the plan, and in regularly monitoring progress. At the end, it tells us what is happening at the ground level.
### ICT patents
The ICT patents refers to the patents which have been granted in order to implement a specific industry standard which are crucial in the ICT industry in order to promote innovation. 
They basically look to protect any type of system that has relation with the ICT sector. 
Due the fact that it has become so useful, it has increased drastically at least 30%, and it includes the areas of computers, the Internet (websites, blogs and emails), live broadcasting technologies (radio, television and webcasting), recorded broadcasting technologies (podcasting, audio and video players and storage devices) and telephony (fixed or mobile, satellite, videoconferencing, etc.).
The most protect areas are high-speed network, mobile communication, digital security, sensor and device networks, high-speed computing among others.

### ICT impact in other areas like Telecommunications, Health, Agriculture, Science, Energy.
* Telecommunications: In this area it has had a positive effect on the way we communicate, as it has made it easier & cheaper. For example, communicating without meeting face to face, a lot of people tend to just communicate over the internet or by texting as this is now easier than arranging to meet up. 
* Health: In health these systems can can promote patient-centered healthcare, improve quality of care, and educate health professionals and patients. In general, improve their practice. It also allows to easy to deliver treatment and care for the patient who is located anywhere around the world.
* Agriculture: It has helped to farmers to focus, search, and extract useful and up-to-date market information from social and business networks. It also heled to make decision easily than before and reduce time. In general, it increased in productivity.
* Science: It has impacted in teaching and learning to students, assist with collecting and analyzing data, increasing global awareness, it also allows to simulate and interactive explore and test experiment to reduce cost among others.


### Historical Stages of the Development of Technology
Technology has been the essential tool of the modernity because we have built or made advanced devices that have helped us in the development of humanity. However, we have gone through several historical stages to arrive at the technology we know today. There are 31 stages now, and they are as follows:

### Relevant Indicators of the Digital Economy.
The digital economy is measured in various ways such as its independence or its great impact on new technologies. However, there are four important indicators that define the
digital economy based on its adaptation nowadays. 

Infrastructure, this indicator covers the development of their security and access to fixed networks for further navigation between networks. It is also in charge of server 
infrastructure and the internet of things. 

Empowering society, this indicator embarks on the use of the digital economy in people's lives, i.e. how to use it, access, interact, among other services. In addition, it is 
responsible for sending information on internet usage, financial inclusion, among others, to users. 

Innovation and adoption of technology, this indicator covers the innovation of the new tools of the digital economy such as financial models, access to technologies such as ICT 
and others that are part of the digital economy. 

Employment and growth, this indicator looks for opportunities within the digital economy based on your finances and good management of the economy, it also learns from your 
movements and use of technology. 

### Impact of ICTs in other areas.
As described above, ICT is the set of information, communication and technology that complement modern computing and large enterprises. In fact, almost all companies rely on the 
use of ICT because it is very practical and innovative in several aspects. 

In areas such as business they have impacts on the development of new tools for the optimization of processes and services that this can promote, Similarly, many areas prefer 
the use of ICT because they are key in the economy and special services. Therefore, in developing countries, it is convenient to use ICT for the benefit of improving digital 
aspects such as the management of the Internet, computers, digital orders, among others. 

## Questions


### Jack
1. What's the objective of the implementation of AI strategies? Name some of them. 

A: Encourage the use IA systems into the general public. Some of those strategies is to encourage the use of IA for public services. 
In the case of the finland, its AuroraIA aims to create a  one-stop-shop  and  human-centric AI-driven  public  services. 



2. List the most prominent challanges faced by the OECD contries for achieving its digital policy objectives.

A:

  - geographical dispersion of the population, including in remote and rural areas
  - budget and financing constraints
  - appropriate co-ordination and interaction of different actors across sectors, ministries and bodies
  - development of effective regulatory instruments and frameworks
  - adaptation to the rapid pace and development of digital technologies



3. Mention some key components for the digital policy developments.

A:
  - Access and connectivity.
   - Households and individuals.
   - Businesses.
   - Digital goverment.
   - Data access, sharing and re-use.
   - Digital security.

4. Mention how could benefit the linking of data across digital systems, metion an example.

Can help optimise administrative workflows to reduce reporting burdens. They can also support performance monitoring and management. Finally, 
they can provide anticipatory intelligence. As an example, we could name a smart city, in which all its devices sent its data to a data warehouse, in which can be consulted by the goverment for different porpuses.

5. What kind of measures some contries have implemented.
 
 Some countries have adopted binding legislation for areas of AI applications deemed high risk. Belgium has prohibited the use of lethal 
autonomous  weapons  by  local  armed  forces.  New  regulations  have  been  issued  on  driverless  cars  or  unmanned  aircraft  systems.

6. How can you define a person that do Strategic Data Analysis?
It is the person performing or directing it has an in depth knowledge and understanding of the industry gained from years of “street experience”.

7. Which are the most common approach that goverment use to deal with digital strategies?
In this case, it is needed to consider the fact that many approach can be used and that in fact, according to the variation in the countries, domestic instututions, goverment organisation or administrative among other. 
However, There are two main types of approach, the first one, countries assign high-level leadership and centralised responsability for strategic co-ordination above ministerial level. 
The second approach, a lead ministry is typicalle in charge of strategy development and strategic co-ordination. Usually this is likely to be most effective. 

8. Why monitoring and evaluating national strategies are important and what is used?
They are essential to know how well an NDS is implement and how effective it is. Some of them use benchmarking surveys, annual or bi-annual status and progress reports, and dashboards with forecasts. In addition, most contries use international metrics and scoreboards to measure natial progress policy objectives set in NDSs.

9. How households and individual have been uptaken and used by Digital Economy?
In many places like Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain reported that explicit policies were stablished. It also stablished to target specific population groups like children, students or people with disabilities.  In this case, non-financial support is the most widespread instrument to promete use of digital technologies.  Direct financial support may go through lead agencies managing programme implementation or take the form of loans, grants, vouchers or specific training.

10. What does need to consider goverment in the aspects of Consumer Policy and what Consumer Policy need to consider? 
Goverment need to consider how to adapt, change and implement consumer policy in thig age of rapid technological progress. Other key  is that goverments must have technical experstisive to understand these emerging issues to engage in effective policy marking and enforcement. On the other hand, Consumer Policy should consider the vulnerabilities of different groups of consumers to target protections and awareness accordingly.

### Hector

11. What technological advances are important? 

All technological advances have been very important for humanity because they helped with the development of tools 
that if it were not for our ancestors we might not have pre-existed in this world. Each historical stage of 
technological development was very influential in its time because they could facilitate tasks that required a lot of work.

12. What other indicator might be relevant to the digital economy?

It could be stability, if we talk about almost all companies use the ICT model, this contains elements that are required a lot
in a company or project (information, communication technologies), that is, we may reach a stability of models and technologies 
where everything is compatible between cell phones or computers.

13. Why is important the Data Analysis? 

Data analysis allows us to explore data in depth to look for patterns or predict future values through models. 
It also allows us to visualize data in a way that is more understandable to the public or to develop models that allow 
the prediction or classification of data to achieve a goal.

14. Does the digital economy have a future? 

The digital economy has a long way to go to be a high gamma technology, it must take care of the models and be adaptable 
to the new technologies that are being created. Therefore, it must maintain its indicators and have system updates.

15. Which area does ICT use the most?

The area that most ICT is the business area because it can be distributed all over the world and has access to more technologies and social contact. 
It has several strategies that some areas need, such as trade or communication between companies.

Well, it can be considered as two points, first it is for them the reorienting the organizations to make strategic use of digital technologies like cloud platforms, social networks and so on. The second one is about the uses of digital technologies to change and orientated the nature of business change itself.

17. If a businesses desire to start the digital transformation, where should the businesses starts?

The main point to consider for the business is that they need to focues first in their own bussines priorities, usually the first priority is to use digital technologies to better connect internal resources to customer across and between various digital and physical channels – to create more compelling customer experiences.

18. Why are ICT patents so important?
This is a simple question but so important in this aspect, and it is because it protect any type of system that has relation with the ICT sector.


19. Which are some advantages and disadvantages of ICT?
  * Advantages: It helps in communication saving time and money, also allow the globalization, reduce the cost, the creation of new jobs and improve the education.
  * Disadvantages: If people has not access to internet or the correct programs, andnot all students have the same educational opportunities. Other ones are overriding cultures, computer viruses, among others.

20. Why Quantum computers are a problem to Cryptographic algorithms? 
It is because many enterprise or companies make uses of them like e-commerce, mobile and online communication, online banking and cloud computing, an all of these uses make the cryptographic algorithms that can be easily break with the Quantum computers.
